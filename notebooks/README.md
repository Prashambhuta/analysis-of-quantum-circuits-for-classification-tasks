# Analysis of Quantum Circuits for Classification Tasks

## Notebooks

This folder contains the notebooks behind this study.

_> experiments_

The three notebooks contain the code and knowledge necessary to recreate the study. 

* [01-experiment-classical-ml.ipynb](01-experiment-classical-ml.ipynb) - for classification using classical method.
* [02-experiment-quantum-vqc.ipynb](02-experiment-quantum-vqc.ipynb) - for classification using variational quantum circuit.
* [03-experiment-quantum-qsvc.ipynb](03-experiment-quantum-qsvc.ipynb) - for classification using quantum support vector classifier.


_> learn_

The notebooks form a series of code helpful to get started with qiskit, and quantum circuits. The titles are self-explanatory.
